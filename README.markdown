Welcome to emu8 Studio project page !
-------------------------------------

In 2006 I began to write my own CPU emulator, Intel 8080. I had fun, but the software lacked many
features. So I decided to enhance the software. Now it has grown to emulation platform
that can emulate arbitrary, not necessarily 8-bit computers. In present time it is implemented
only MITS Altair 8800 computer with Intel 8080 CPU, 64kB RAM, MITS 88-DISK controller with up to
16 disk drives and terminal device ([LSI ADM-3A][adm3a]).
Plugins are available in other repositories.

It is based on plugins that can be developed independently. Besides emulation process,
the platform can be used as good source-code editor with compiler for selected platform.
