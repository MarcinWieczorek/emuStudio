emuStudio is free and versatile platform for computer emulation. It is written in Java, which makes
it a naturally cross-platform application.

The description of plug-ins combinations is a description of a virtual computer. Plug-ins represent
computer components.

Plug-ins are developed separately, following so-called communication model. Anyone can take those
components and combine them into a working computer, just by drawing simple computer schema.

Main purpose of emuStudio is to support education process of mainly old hardware. The platform has
been used at Technical University of Ko≈°ice (Slovakia) with very good responses of students and
teachers since 2007.
