# Welcome to emuStudio
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vbmacher/emuStudio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vbmacher/emuStudio)

emuStudio is a desktop application which allows to write programs and emulate computers.
In addition, it is easily extensible - acting as a framework it encourages developers to write their computer emulators.
It is versatile, free, and written in Java.

The main goal is to support learning about older but important computers or abstract machines. 
I think it is also appropriate for schools; for example, emuStudio is used at
[Technical University of KoÅ¡ice](http://www.fei.tuke.sk/en) since 2007.

## BIG THANKS

Big thanks goes to the one and only [simh](http://simh.trailing-edge.com/) project, which inspired me a lot, and helped
me as a student and emulator enthusiast when working on emuStudio. I wish emuStudio will reach it's simplicity and
emulators "richness" as the simh project has.  

# License

This project is released under GNU GPL v2 license.

# Supported host platform

Currently supported are Linux and Windows. Mac is NOT supported, but it might work to some extent.

# Available computer emulators

* MITS Altair8800 with two processor choices: Intel 8080 or Zilog Z80 CPU. Includes 88-DISK drive, 88-SIO board,
  LSI ADM-3A terminal, SIMH pseudo device (partially reimplemented from simh emulator), operating memory,
  and 8080 + Z80 assembler compilers

* Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) emulator, with programming tutorials

* Random Access Machine (RAM) simulator

* Random Access Stored Program (RASP) machine simulator 

* Brainfuck interpreter (designed as a "computer" which I called BrainDuck)

# For developers

In order to quickly "get into" emuStudio programming is to read
[tutorials for writing plug-ins](https://vbmacher.github.io/emuStudio/docdevel/emulator_tutorial/index/).

The project uses Maven for managing dependencies and build process. Each module can be compiled separately,
but if you run the following command in the root directory, it will compile each module (results will be in
particular module directory):

```
mvn clean install
```

## Creating a custom "release"

In order to package complete emuStudio with examples and all predefined computers, at first compile the whole
project. Then go to directory `release` and invoke the following command:

```
mvn clean install -P release
```

Inside the `target` subdirectory will be a zip file containing the custom release of emuStudio.

# Running / installation

There are two ways of how to run emuStudio. In both cases, a prerequisite is to have a full release of emuStudio.
You can either download it from [project's web page](https://vbmacher.github.io/emuStudio/download/),
or you can prepare it according to the previous section.

## The "classic" way

The requirement is to have installed Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8.

Unzip the emuStudio distribution zip file (`emuStudio-xxx.zip`) and run it using command:

```
java -jar emuStudio.jar
```

## Using Vagrant

It is also possible to use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) in order to run emuStudio. This way does not
require to install JRE, but virtual box must be installed. Also it works only for custom releases, as described
above.

Assuming the release is prepared, run the script in the root directory of emuStudio:

```
> ./emuStudio-vagrant.sh
```

The script does the following:

1. It boots or resumes the already-prepared virtual machine with preinstalled Linux and Java using
   [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
2. Synchronizes `release/target/` subdirectory with the machine.
3. Then it unzips the release zip file into VM's `/emustudio/` directory
4. Finally, it runs emuStudio from the virtual machine (using SSH with X forwarding).
