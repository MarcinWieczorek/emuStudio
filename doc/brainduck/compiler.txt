== Compiler `brainc-brainduck`

BrainDuck is an abstract computer for emuStudio, which mimics http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck[brainfuck] programming language. Originally, brainfuck was developped by
http://esolangs.org/wiki/Urban_M%C3%BCller[Urban Miller] and it is well-known fact that the language
has minimalistic compiler and it's eight instructions don't prevent it to be Turing complete. Also,
there exist many extensions of the language and there are organized programming contests in
brainfuck worldwide. But all of that can be read at Wikipedia or at other sources.

BrainDuck architecture is just a name for virtual computer in emuStudio, and consists of these
plug-ins:

- `brainc-compiler`: Compiler of brainfuck language (original, without extensions)
- `brainduck-cpu`: Brainfuck emulator acting like CPU with two registers
- `brainduck-mem`: Virtual operating memory which holds both compiled brainfuck program and data
- `brainduck-terminal`: Virtual terminal for displaying the output and requesting for input.

All these plug-ins are free software, released under GNU GPL v2 license. The source code is freely
available online.

Implementation language is Java SE 7. The implementation technology of visual components is Java
Swing. All plug-ins use library `emuLib` version `9.0.0`.
