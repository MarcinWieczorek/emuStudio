== Command line arguments

emuStudio accepts several command line arguments. Their description is accessible with `--help`
argument:

	$ java -jar emuStudio.jar --help
	emuStudio will accept the following command line parameters:

	--config name : load configuration with file name
	--input name  : use the source code given by the file name
	--output name : output compiler messages into this file name
	--auto        : run the emulation automatization
	--nogui       : try to not show GUI in automatization
	--help        : output this message

Most of these arguments are self-explanatory. Some of them have meaning only when emulation
automatization is turned on (`--nogui`). For more information, please refer to section
<<XA,Automatic emulation>>.
