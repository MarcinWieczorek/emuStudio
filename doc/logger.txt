== Logger configuration

This is an advanced topic, but you might need it if something goes wrong. No software is bug-free in
these days, and not a person is perfect. Sometimes it might happen that emuStudio is not working
as expected, either it does not start (with weird message on screen), or it fails while running.

For that purpose, everything important is being logged (by default) in a log file. The log file
is named `emuStudio.log` and should be located in the location where `emuStudio.jar` is located.
Every new run of emuStudio appends log messages from time-to-time into that file until emuStudio
is terminated.

TIP: The log file is the best help about what went wrong for a developer which is trying to analyze
     or fix the problem. If you have encountered a problem with emuStudio, you should provide the log
     file for further analysis.

Format, file name and content of the log file can be influenced. EmuStudio is using `logback` as the
logging system. Configuration of the logging mechanism is in the file called `logback.xml`. For
more information about how to configure loggers, please look at the page http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html.
