== Opening a computer

The first action which emuStudio does is loading a computer to be emulated. Virtual computers are
described in abstract schemas, which are stored in configuration files (see <<XIID,Directory structure>> section). 

Computers can be loaded either from <<XC,command line>> or manually in GUI (default). The
open dialog is the first thing which appears to a user.

Left part contains a control panel and a list of all available virtual computers. When a user
clicks at a computer, it's abstract schema is displayed on the right. Double-clicking or clicking
on the `Open` button loads selected computer.

- *A*: Adds new computer. The abstract schema editor will be opened.
- *B*: Deletes selected computer. Be aware of what you are doing - the action cannot be undone.
- *C*: Edits selected computer. The abstract schema editor will be opened.
- *D*: Saves the displayed abstract schema into image file.

=== Abstract schema editor

Abstract schema editor is a graphical editor for drawing abstract schemas of virtual computers
for emulation in emuStudio. Users pick plug-ins which appear as "boxes" or elements on the screen.
Then using connection lines those elements can be connected together to express a relation (that they
can "see" each other).

When the abstract schema is completed, user must save it and then it will appear in the
<<XOM,Open a computer>> dialog.

Description of the control panel follows.

- *A*: Save the virtual computer.
- *B*: Select a compiler.
- *C*: Select a CPU.
- *D*: Select a memory.
- *E*: Select a device.
- *F*: Use a connection line. The line is bidirectional by default.
- *G*: Set or unset the connection line to be bidirectional. If the line is not bidirectional,
       the source direction is the first clicked element and the target direction is the second
       clicked element.
- *H*: Remove an element from the schema.
- *I*: This drop-down list is used for selecting specific plug-in (element) in the abstract schema.
       See icons `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E`. Those names are just file names of plug-ins located in
       corresponding directory (see <<XIID,Directory structure>> section).
- *J*: Use / do not use a grid in the editor. Elements are "snapped" to the grid if it is used
       and it's easier to draw the schema which looks good. The slider on the right then controls
       density of the grid. The density is saved in the configuration file of the edited computer.
