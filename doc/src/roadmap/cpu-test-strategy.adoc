= CPU test strategy

CPUs should be tested properly - each instruction. Manually create test examples takes too much time and with very
small effect, since it tests only a tiny subset of all possible cases. Test examples should be generated automatically
and the programmer should write tests in lambda-style.

== Description

The lambda-style DSL language should be based on the following ideas (how-to-test):

* Transfer
** immediate
** from memory
** from register

* Flags test
** simple - S,Z,P,N
** carry - H,C
** overflow - P/V

* Displacements test
** (IX+d), (IY+d)
** relative jumps

* Instruction/memory size
** 16-bit, 8-bit

The point is to design huge variety of tests easily and focus on testing property rather than on the whole instruction
test.
