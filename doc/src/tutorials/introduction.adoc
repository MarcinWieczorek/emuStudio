This guide shall help you, the developer, to write your own virtual computer for emuStudio. From now on, every time
a 'virtual computer' will be mentioned, it should be always understood as a computer emulator written for emuStudio, if
it won't be said otherwise.

= Introduction

== What is emuStudio

From user's point of view, emuStudio can be understood as an *emulation platform*, because it can run various emulators
in the same environment. It has a simple IDE, debugger and other features like automatic emulation, which makes emuStudio
quite powerful.

From developer's point of view, it is also a *framework*, because it provides API and lifecycle management for virtual
computers. There are some contracts how things work, what developer can count with, and what is not defined. This
tutorial shall guide the developer through these waters, hopefully at the end there won't be any serious problems with
writing custom virtual computers.

=== Core technologies

During programming, there are some commonly used technologies, which are mandatory when relevant. These are the "core
technologies", which are listed in the following table:

CAUTION: emuStudio uses Maven for the build lifecycle management. All dependencies and their versions are defined in
      the root `pom.xml` file. When you use a library or some technology which is listed there, please use the
      same version as it is used by emuStudio. You will avoid unexpected conflicts or behavior of your plug-ins.

=== Contributing

Anyone can contribute to emuStudio. It is a free software, licensed with GNU GPL 2 license. The source code is available
on GitHub, at https://github.com/vbmacher/emuStudio.

emuStudio project has some predefined set of virtual computers. So far, this set is contained within each emuStudio
distribution. However, adding new computers to standard emuStudio must be consulted with the author in advance. While
I encourage people writing their own computers, I assume they will be mostly students having only little experience
and/or per-semester projects which will end when the student passes. This is perfectly fine, but those projects should
be kept rather in different repositories.

Also, in the future there might be something like plug-in repository, and user would download what he wants manually.
So far, it is not like that and it is too soon to consider this.

== What is a virtual computer

A computer generally can be decomposed to some cooperating components (still very high-level), like CPU, bus, memory,
or devices. It is not far different from how it is in emuStudio. As the basic concept for virtual computer was taken the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture[von Neumann model of a computer]. The computer defines three
types of core components: CPU (control unit and arithmetic-logic unit), memory, and input/output devices. In emuStudio,
virtual computer also has those components, but the possibilities of interconnection and cooperation are not bound
to hardware limits or philosophy.

Each component of a virtual computer is a separate plug-in written in Java. A virtual computer is then just a set of
cooperating plug-ins which are loaded and initialized by emuStudio. The selection of plugins is handled externally, by
the user of emuStudio. The plugins list is extended with information about plug-in interconnection, which is specific
for each computer. Then we have something which is called *abstract schema*. But as was said, abstract schemas are
prepared by user, not plug-in developer.

For more information about how to create such a schema, please read the user manual. The whole process of loading and
initializing the plug-ins into working emulator is completely handled by emuStudio. Developer must hold to some
contracts, and principles of good object-oriented design, which are enough for ensuring that everything will work as
expected.

The following schema defines all plug-in types and their possible interconnections, as it is currently in emuStudio.

[graphviz]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
graph virtual_computer {
  splines=true;
  sep="+25,125";
  overlap=scalexy;
  nodesep=1;
  ranksep=1;
  node [shape = rect];

  Compiler -- Device [headlabel="0..N", taillabel="0..1" , labeldistance=2.5];
  Compiler -- CPU [headlabel="0..1", taillabel="0..1" ];
  Compiler -- Memory [headlabel="0..1", taillabel="0..1" ];

  CPU -- Memory [headlabel="0..1", labeldistance=2.5, taillabel="0..1" ];
  CPU -- Device [headlabel="0..N", taillabel="0..1" ];

  Memory -- Device [headlabel="0..N", taillabel="0..1" ];
  Device -- Device [ label = "0..N" ];

  {rank=same; Compiler Memory};
  {rank=same; CPU Device};
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see, there are no restrictions about which plug-in can "see" or cooperate with another plug-in. For example,
a compiler can access all computer components, including CPU, devices and memory.

TIP: Most probably a compiler would want to access memory, it which case it would be able to load a compiled program
     directly there. But the reason why the compiler is allowed to access also other components is that the compiled
     program can contain either some information about initial states, or initial data which are needed to be preloaded
     into other components before program can be started (for example, content of abstract tapes in the case of RAM
     machine).

== Emulation lifecycle and behavior contracts

emuStudio is also a framework, which not only defines the API, but also the whole life cycle of plug-ins, and has the
control of all emulation processes. It proactively loads, initializes and initiates plug-in actions. That way, a plug-in
developer does not have to care about it, and can safely focus on what the plug-in should do in the first place.

Behavior contracts define the operations and their order in all phases of emulation life cycle, which plug-ins must
count with. Taken that, plug-ins can then assume the state in which are the other plug-ins, or emuStudio itself and
shape their own behavior accordingly. emuStudio is also assuming that plug-ins will "behave good", and if not, it can
affect or possibly corrupt the whole emulator. In that case the state of emuStudio and other plug-ins is not defined.

More details, including programming examples about the life cycle and behavior contracts will be presented later.

== Plug-in basics

Each plug-in is a separate Java module, usually single jar file, placed in the proper directory. As it is necessary
to place the plug-in to proper location (`compilers/`, `cpu/`, `mem/`, and `devices/`), dependencies of both emuStudio
and all plug-ins should be included in `lib/` directory. The reason is to help ensuring that versions of shared
dependencies across plug-ins themselves and across emuStudio must be the same within single emuStudio distribution.

In emuStudio, plug-in source codes are located in `plugins/` subdirectory, then separated by plug-in type. For example:

https://github.com/vbmacher/emuStudio/tree/branch-0_39/plugins

In order to contribute to an existing plug-in, you can find the plug-in in some subdirectory. If you want to add a
new plug-in which should exist in the default emuStudio distribution, you would create new plug-in in that place as well.

CAUTION: Standard or "default" plug-ins force to use Maven and you must follow the standard which will be defined later.
      Also, before making any design changes or new plug-in development, please contact the emuStudio author.

Usually, your plug-ins will not be the standard part of default emuStudio distribution. In that case, you are not forced
to use Maven or any other technology, except of emuStudio API, contracts and the limits which might exist when involving
unknown third party dependencies. Also, you can use your own code style if you like.
