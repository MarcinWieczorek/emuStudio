== Introduction

Computer MITS Altair 8800 was named after a planet in one of the first episodes of Star Trek series. Having Intel 8080
CPU inside, with 256 bytes of memory, no display and keyboard is this computer, when comparing to the present era,
absolutely ridiculous. His author, Ed Roberts, called the invention "personal computer", which is now very common term.
As Wikipedia states:

[quote, Wikipedia, Altair 8800]
The Altair is widely recognized as the spark that ignited the microcomputer revolution.

Altair 8800 is one of the oldest commercially available computers overall. Ed Roberts (founder and CEO of MITS
corporation) was selling these machines by mail directly from the factory.

Various enthusiasts understood the power of Altair and started to develop software and hardware for the computer. Those
people saw a freedom in Altair - some kind of a release from batch tasks ran on mainframe systems, maintained by elite.
The phenomenon of a computer which could be put on the kitchen table allowed to make enormous money by two smart
university students. In 1975, Paul Allen and Bill Gates wrote a trimmed version of BASIC programming language, called
Altair BASIC, which pushed them directly to foundation of Microsoft corporation.

Basic configuration of MITS Altair 8800 was:

== Altair8800 for emuStudio

In emuStudio, there exist two variants of the computer. These variants varies only with the used CPU. There is available
either Intel 8080 emulator, or Zilog Z80 emulator. Lots of behavior and some devices was inspired by
http://simh.trailing-edge.com/[simh] emulator.

Abstract schema for emuStudio (Intel 8080):

Abstract schema for emuStudio (Zilog Z80):

The following plug-ins are used in the schemas. Each plug-in is described in much more detail in its own section.

- Compiler: <<XA8080,as-8080>>
- Compiler: <<XAZ80,as-z80>>
- Operating memory (RAM): <<XASMEM,standard-mem>>
- CPU: `8080-cpu`
- CPU: `z80-cpu`
- Device: <<XS,88-sio>>
- Device: <<XD,88-disk>>
- Device: <<XSPSEUDO,simhPseudo-z80>>
