Virtual device partially reimplemented from http://simh.trailing-edge.com/[simh] emulator. This device is used
mainly for communication between CP/M 3 operating system for `simh` and emuStudio. Most of the original functionality
is not implemented, but it is crucial for support of memory bank-switching.
