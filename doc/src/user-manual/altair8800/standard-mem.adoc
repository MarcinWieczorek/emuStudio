== Operating memory `standard-mem`

This plug-in emulates an operating memory, in a quite broad meaning. It can be used for any virtual
computer which can benefit from the following basic properties:

- A memory cell has size of 1 byte (8 bits)
- Memory cells are linearly ordered (sequential)
- Each memory cell is accessible by unique address, representing
  the index of the memory cell, if the memory is imagined as an array of cells

Besides, the memory supports these additional features:

- Setting up ROM (read only memory) ranges
- Changing memory size; by default it is 64kB
- Support of bank switching

There are also some "interactive" features:

- Manual loading/saving memory images in either binary or Intel HEX format
- Ability to automatically load a memory image at startup
- Intuitive control using keystrokes, and nice visual presentation of the data

This operating memory is (for now) used only in 8-bit emulator of MITS Altair8800. However it
is possible to develop an emulator which can benefit from it.

[[STANDARD-MEM_GUI]]
=== GUI overview

To open the memory GUI (graphical user interface), click at the right-most icon in the debug toolbar, on the Emulator panel.
The window is shown at the following image:

image::images/standard-mem.png[Standard operating memory]

- *A*: Deletes all memory content.
- *B*: Refreshes memory view, if you have a feeling that the shown content is not updated
- *C*: Open a memory image. Current memory content, if it does not interfere with the loaded data
       will be kept.
- *D*: Save memory content into a file.
- *E*: Show memory settings
- *F*: Find address / goto address. The address can be either in decimal, hexadecimal (prefix `0x`)
       or octal (prefix `0`) format.
- *G*: By double-clicking on the memory cell it is possible to edit it and change its value.
       The value format is the same as when finding address (see *F*).
- *H*: Page of the memory view. The whole memory cannot be shown in single window, because it can
       be quite large (64 kB by default), so it was divided into pages.
- *I*: If the memory has set up memory banks, it is possible to change the view to different bank.
       Switching in here has no effect on the emulator and on the active bank.
- *J*: Displays the data of a selected cell in various forms.

Generally, it is possible to move around the cells using keystrokes (arrows). If user presses some
other letter/number key, a small text field appears allowing to edit the current value. When editing
is finished, user can press ENTER key to confirm it, or ESC key to discard the editing.

[[STANDARD-MEM_SETTINGS]]
=== Memory settings

Settings window can be opened by clicking on "settings" icon in the main GUI window:

image::images/standard-mem-settings.png[Memory settings]

- *A*: Settings for memory bank-switching
- *B*: Settings for ROM areas
- *C*: If checked, settings for ROM areas will be saved to the configuration file
- *D*: List of memory images which will be loaded at startup
- *E*: The button will apply the settings

ROM areas and memory bank-switching is explained in the following sections.

[[STANDARD-MEM_ROM]]
==== ROM areas

Some "controllers" - used as embedded devices - usually logically organize memory into areas, some of
which are read only, which usually contains the firmware, and some are rewritable. Physically, these memories
are wired to specific addresses, so the programmer can access them.

Standard operating memory plug-in emulates this behavior. It allows to define ROM areas which represent read only
memory. There can be set up multiple ROM areas, and they can overlap. Effectively it means that memory cells in
ROM area cannot be changed from software running on the emulator. All writes to the memory will be ignored.

Manually, as a user it is possible to change the values, but only by loading new memory image. Editing the value
will not work.

If a ROM range is defined, it is possible to remove only a part of it, effectively splitting the range and correcting their
boundaries. For example, if there is defined a ROM range from 0x0A - 0x64 (see the image above), then it is possible
to remove a range e.g. 0x32 - 0x46, which is the part of defined ROM area. Then, the original ROM area is split into
two parts - first will be a range from 0x0A - 0x31, and the second from 0x47 - 0x64.

[[STANDARD-MEM_ROM]]
==== Memory bank-switching

This technique was invented as a workaround for a problem when the address space of a processor was smaller than memory
size. In order to overcome this issue, memory was logically split into many regions of size equal to the processor address
space. These regions are called "banks".

Physically, banks could refer to the same memory, but they could be also different memories (e.g. external cartridges),
and the bank-switching involved switching the active memory.

Selecting a bank from a programming perspective was usually done by writing some code to some I/O port using some I/O
instruction of a CPU. But it can be implemented in various ways, e.g. some memory addresses can be used for selecting
a bank.

Also, it was very common that some part of the address space still kept some common memory part which was never switched
out. This part is called a "common" part. In emuStudio, common part starts with the `Common` address (as it can be seen
in the Settings dialog image above) and ends till the rest of the CPU address space (or memory end).

To summarize, let's consider an example. If a CPU is 8-bit, it means it has address space of size 2^8 - i.e. it can
access memory from address 0 to (2^8 - 1). If the memory was larger, CPU just doesn't allow to access higher memory
cells. So memory bank-switching is coming for the rescue. If the memory has 2 MB, we require `2^log2(2MB) = 2^21` addresses.
So, if we won't have any common address space, we require `ceil(21 / 8) = 3` banks:

- bank 0: maps from 0 - (2^8 - 1)
- bank 1: maps from 2^8 - (2^16 - 1)
- bank 2: maps from 2^16 - (2^21 - 1)
