== Introduction

emuStudio is graphical application allowing software-based computer emulation. Computer emulation can
be explained as imitation of computer behaviour. There can be various levels of accuracy, or detail.

It's free software, released under GNU GPL v2 license. The source code is freely available online.
Implementation language is Java SE 7, which makes emuStudio a naturally cross-platform application.
The implementation technology of visual components is Java Swing.

=== Brief description

Various computers can be emulated. Real computers are assembled using hardware components, which are
in virtual environment represented by plug-ins. All virtual computers in emuStudio must have compiler,
one CPU and memory. Devices are optional. The virtual computer model is very similar to von Neumann model.

Plug-ins combinations and computer settings are written in configuration files. Each file represents
one single computer. These configurations can be created manually (they're Java properties files), but
more convenient is an abstract schema editor.

Source code editor enables users to write programs for emulated computer. Very related part is
compiler, which provides lexical and syntax analysis of the source code for the syntax highlighting. Most compiler
plug-ins enable direct transfer of the written code into emulated computer.

Some memory plug-ins allow modification of its content, which is immediately seen by CPU.

There exist command line interface which allows automation of emulation. It is useful for running programs
without graphical interface - some devices allow gathering input and writing output from/to files.

Errors, and other messages are written in log file. If there is some problem, user can check the log file,
or pass it to the issue for analysis by developers of emuStudio.

=== Installation and run

At first, please download emuStudio distribution. It is a ZIP file in the form `emuStudio-[VERSION].zip`.
Unpack the file where you want to have emuStudio installed.

NOTE: please don't forget to install Java Runtime Environment (JRE) of version 7 and later.

After unzipping, go to the directory where `emuStudio.jar` is located, and run it with command from command
line:

....
java -jar emuStudio.jar
....

==== Directory structure

emuStudio has very conservative and strict directory structure, as can be seen in the following
list:

- `config/`: location of configuration files. Each file represents abstract schema of one virtual
             (emulated) computer.footnote:[The name of the file is the name of the computer, which
             is not very good idea.] The files are human-readable.footnote:[Format of the files is
             http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties[Java properties].]
- `compilers/`: location of compiler plug-ins.
- `cpu/`: location of CPU plug-ins.
- `devices/`: location of device plug-ins.
- `mem/`: location of memory plug-ins.
- `lib/`: location of shared libraries.
