== Booting operating systems

Since this virtual computer emulates a real machine, it's possible to use real software written for the computer.
As was mentioned in <<XA,Altair for emuStudio>> section, several operating systems and programs can be run on Altair.
There are many disk and memory images of those systems available online, but only some were tested and proved to work.

Most of the disk images usable in emuStudio are borrowed from great SIMH emulator footnote:[http://simh.trailing-edge.com/].
Some images were modified for SIMH, by which they lose some sort of originality, but definitely not functionality.

Tested and fully-functional images were:

- Operating system CP/M v2.2 and 3
- Altair DOS v1.0
- BASIC programming language in various versions

The following subsections describe in short how to boot those systems, along with screenshots how it looks.
