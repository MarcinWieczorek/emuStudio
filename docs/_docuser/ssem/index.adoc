[[emulator_ssem]]
= Emulator of SSEM

Well, there is no user documentation for the SSEM computer. This computer is provided as the result of the developer's
tutorial of how to implement a custom computer in emuStudio.

I strongly suggest to look at link:/docdevel/emulator_tutorial/index/[this nice tutorial]!
