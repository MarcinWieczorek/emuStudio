## A bit of history

Project 'emuStudio' started in 2006 as a semester project. I have continued to work on it afterwards, and graduated
with a final thesis named *emuStudio - universal emulation platform*. It was my very first project in Java.

My supervisor was [Slavomír Šimoňák](https://kpi.fei.tuke.sk/sk/person/slavomir-simonak), and here I want to thank him
a lot for his very concise and conceptual leadership of the first versions of the project. Lots of good ideas and
project directions came from our discussions, of which I have only good memories. 

After graduating from school I had not much time for it, but I still find some little spare time to either improve
something, or fix bugs. Also, the project is being used in Technical University in Košice, Slovakia, by students
on various subjects, like:
 
- Programming in machine-oriented languages
- Programming techniques and algorithms

Sometimes students extend emuStudio, so there might be a bright side of its future. For example,
there are two projects which were incorporated in or used by emuStudio:

- [Edigen](https://github.com/sulir/edigen), made by [Matúš Sulír](https://sulir.github.io/)
- [RASP machine](/docuser/rasp/index), made by Michal Šipoš

I would like to thank them for the contribution, and hope that there will be more students or anyone wishing to
work on something regarding emuStudio.

## Getting the support

If you are seeking for help with emuStudio, you have two options. Preferred way is to raise
an [issue](https://github.com/vbmacher/emuStudio/issues).
The second option is to directly write an email to the [author](mailto:pjakubco@gmail.com).
In fact, I will be pleased to hear any feedback or ideas of how emuStudio might get improved.

Responses to the issues/emails might be slow, as this project is still mostly a one-person show, and it's a hobby.
Thank you for understanding.
