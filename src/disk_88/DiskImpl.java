/**
 * MITS 88-DISK Floppy Disk controller with up to eight drives (although I
 * think that the interface can actually support up to 16 drives). The connected
 * floppy drives were Pertec FD-400 8" hard-sectored floppy drives. Each
 * single-sided diskette has 77 tracks of 32, 137-byte sectors each (an
 * unformatted capacity of 337,568 bytes). The controller supported neither
 * interrupts nor DMA, so floppy access required the sustained attention of
 * the CPU. The standard I/O addresses were 10Q-12Q.
 *
 *    The controller is interfaced to the CPU by use of 3 I/O addreses,
 *   standardly, these are device numbers 10, 11, and 12 (octal).
 *

 *      10              In              Indicates status of Drive and Controller
 *      11              Out             Controls Disk Function
 *      11              In              Indicates current sector position of disk

 *  Drive Select Out (Device 10 OUT):
 *
 *  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *  | C | X | X | X |   Device      |
 *  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *
 *  C = If this bit is 1, the disk controller selected by 'device' is
 *      cleared. If the bit is zero, 'device' is selected as the
 *      device being controlled by subsequent I/O operations.
 *  X = not used
 *  Device = value zero thru 15, selects drive to be controlled.

 *  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *  | R | Z | I | X | X | H | M | W |
 *  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *
 *  W - When 0, write circuit ready to write another byte.
 *  M - When 0, head movement is allowed
 *  H - When 0, indicates head is loaded for read/write
 *  X - not used (will be 0)
 *  I - When 0, indicates interrupts enabled (not used this emulator)
 *  Z - When 0, indicates head is on track 0
 *  R - When 0, indicates that read circuit has new byte to read
 *
 *  Drive Control (Device 11 OUT):
 *
 *  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *  | W | C | D | E | U | H | O | I |
 *  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *
 *  I - When 1, steps head IN one track
 *  O - When 1, steps head OUT out track
 *  H - When 1, loads head to drive surface
 *  U - When 1, unloads head
 *  E - Enables interrupts (ignored this simulator)
 *  D - Disables interrupts (ignored this simulator)
 *  C - When 1 lowers head current (ignored this simulator)
 *  W - When 1, starts Write Enable sequence:   W bit on device 10
 *      (see above) will go 1 and data will be read from port 12
 *      until 137 bytes have been read by the controller from
 *      that port.  The W bit will go off then, and the sector data
 *      will be written to disk. Before you do this, you must have
 *      stepped the track to the desired number, and waited until
 *      the right sector number is presented on device 11 IN, then
 *      set this bit.
 *
 *  Sector Position (Device 11 IN):
 *
 *  As the sectors pass by the read head, they are counted and the
 *  number of the current one is available in this register.
 *
 *  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *  | X | X |  Sector Number    | T |
 *  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *
 *  X = Not used
 *  Sector number = binary of the sector number currently under the
 *      head, 0-31.
 *  T = Sector True, is a 1 when the sector is positioned to read or
 *      write.
