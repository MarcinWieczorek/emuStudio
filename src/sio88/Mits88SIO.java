 *
 * KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID
 * some things just: YOU AREN'T GONNA NEED IT
 *
 *
 * These functions support a simulated MITS 2SIO interface card.
 * The card had two physical I/O ports which could be connected
 * to any serial I/O device that would connect to a current loop,
 * RS232, or TTY interface.  Available baud rates were jumper
 * selectable for each port from 110 to 9600.
 *
 * All I/O is via programmed I/O.  Each each has a status port
 * and a data port.
 * 
 * From: http://www.altair32.com/Altair32specs.htm
 * The standard I/O addresses assigned by MITS was 20Q-21Q  for the first port
 * and 22Q-23Q for the second. The second port of the 2SIO is "connected" to a
 * virtual line printer and the paper tape reader/punch for support under CP/M.
