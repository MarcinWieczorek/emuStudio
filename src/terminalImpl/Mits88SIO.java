 * Mits88SIO_2.java
 *
 * Created on Utorok, 2007, november 13, 17:01
 *
 * KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID
 * some things just: YOU AREN'T GONNA NEED IT
 *
 *
 * These functions support a simulated MITS 2SIO interface card.
 * The card had two physical I/O ports which could be connected
 * to any serial I/O device that would connect to a current loop,
 * RS232, or TTY interface.  Available baud rates were jumper
 * selectable for each port from 110 to 9600.
 *
 * All I/O is via programmed I/O.  Each each has a status port
 * and a data port.  A write to the status port can select
 * some options for the device (0x03 will reset the port).
 * A read of the status port gets the port status:
 *
 *  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *  | X   X   X   X   X   X   O   I |
 *  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *
 * I - A 1 in this bit position means a character has been received
 *     on the data port and is ready to be read.
 * O - A 1 in this bit means the port is ready to receive a character
 *     on the data port and transmit it out over the serial line.
 *
 * A read to the data port gets the buffered character, a write
 * to the data port writes the character to the device.
 *
 * Meaning of all bits:
 * 7. 0 - Output device ready (a ready pulse was sent from device) also causes
 *        a hardware interrupt if is enabled
 *    1 - not ready
 * 6. not used
 * 5. 0 -
 *    1 - data available (a word of data is in the buffer on the I/O board)
 * 4. 0 -
 *    1 - data overflow (a new word of data has been received before the previous
 *        word was inputed to the accumulator)
 * 3. 0 -
 *    1 - framing error (data bit has no valid stop bit)
 * 2. 0 -
 *    1 - parity error (received parity does not agree with selected parity)
 * 1. 0 - 
 *    1 - X-mitter buffer empty (the previous data word has been X-mitted and a new data
 *        word may be outputted
 * 0. 0 - Input device ready (a ready pulse has been sent from the device)
 * 
 * From: http://www.altair32.com/Altair32specs.htm
 * The standard I/O addresses assigned by MITS was 20Q-21Q  for the first port and 22Q-23Q
 * for the second. The second port of the 2SIO is "connected" to a virtual line printer and
 * the paper tape reader/punch for support under CP/M.
